# VaidyaSetu_proof_of_concept
VaidyaSetu - A bridge that connects the farmers collecting herbs with ayurvedic properties while maintaining transparency, and fool proof data collection, gaining trust and confidence among the ayurvedic line of product supply.  
##Concept
The main concept focuses on having a *blockcahin ledger* using *HyeperLedger Fabric* an open-source, enterprise-grade, permissioned distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform designed from the outset for enterprise use, hosted under the Linux Foundation, while also inculding API's such as *GeoCode API* for converting the input location in the foramt of longitude and latitude to pinpoint the exact location and using *Maps API* to set up pinpoint markers.By integrating FHIR-style metadata bundles (e.g., "CollectionEvent," "QualityTest," "ProcessingStep") and QR-code scanning at aggregation nodes, stakeholders gain end-to-end visibility, enabling rapid verification of provenance, streamlined certification for export and robust audit trails to support both biodiversity conservation and supply-chain efficiency. When herbs are formulated into finished products, unique, serialised QR codes generated by the blockchain platform could be affixed to each package.
##API's and Inpiration
The current Prototype after much failures, I have created a WEB portal for VaidyaSetu to take data as input from a farmer with his batch code generated through Adhaar verification on the day of the farmers/collectors registration with VaidyaSetu, we took inspiration of the batch ID concept from our daily "coolies" in our railways where they are provided with thier "coolie no" and is much more easy to enter data rather than names. After entring the given batch ID the herb name, and location is entered the maps will try to locate using the *Geocode API*, and talking about API's instead of using big names such as Google API's where we extract they API key and integrate them one with the backend and frontend, we used python - a light weight but a powerful language which is in demand for its user friendly syntax and diverse libraries, we used- 1.Flask - to connect our frontend and backend since the prototype is light weight. 2.Used HTML, JSS, and Leaflet.js(An Open source Java script for Interactive Maps). 3.OpenStreetMap tiles : free map tiles used by Leaflet. 4.CoreConcept that incude Hashing (sha256), QR Code Generation and finally 5.APIs / Services :Nominatim API (OpenStreetMap)– forward geocoding (address > latitude/longitude).No API key required for low-volume usage.Used instead of Google Maps / Google Geocoding API to avoid billing issues. We made this desicion after testing, debugging and researching with 3 more prototypes that significatly had a lot of improvement in each, while also learning how we can use open source, free to use, and easy to integrate options instead of just running behind big names that serve no purpose if our code is facing issues with it.
##DATA storage
Talking about Data, I want u to look at our prototype and just know that even with such a small scale project we did not use big names, devloper databases such as MongoDB, MySQL which are very trendy to use as a product we used to demonstrate but databases like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc. that are great for developers to build applications, prototypes, or general-purpose workloads but not always designed for ultra-high-throughput, analytics-at-scale, or time-series ingestion at millions of writes per second and indeed no matter how big we upgrade the server vertically ( upgrading the tech ) or horizontally ( increasing the number of servers ) they will melt, since they are never really designed to take millions of data poured into every second or taking in thousands of different kind of data like number, characters, or even images and mainly are easy to tamper, which defeats the sole purpose of having a transperent tamper proof data management. Our prototype stores data using in-memory storage. This is a simple list in Python that lives in the computer's temporary memory (RAM). When you click "Add Record," the data from the form is added to this list.The list acts as a temporary ledger, holding all the records as long as the application is running.For a final solution, this would not be a single list. The data would be stored on a distributed ledger that is shared across multiple computers in a peer-to-peer network, making it permanent and tamper-proof. But we faced yet another challenge In our prototype, the data is tamper-proof, but it is not persistent. The moment the server shuts down, the data is lost. This is a deliberate design choice for a proof of concept. Our in-memory blockchain proves that once a record is created, it cannot be altered. For a final solution, we would move this data to a distributed ledger like Hyperledger Fabric, which is designed for persistence and would not be deleted when the server stops. Our Final Design will have cloud storages such as *AWS S3* or *Azur Blob* since you would need a persistent place to store your blockchain data. While the core "ledger" would live on a distributed network like Hyperledger Fabric, the actual data and files (like lab results, photos, and other metadata) would often be stored in cloud object storage.Here is how "immutable" and "append-only" properties of these services are used: 1.Append-Only: This means you can only add new data; you cannot change or delete existing data. This is the perfect complement to your blockchain's design. When a new herb record is created, its data would be saved in a file in cloud storage. The blockchain would then store the unique identifier and cryptographic hash of that file. 2.Immutability: Once a file is written to this type of storage, it cannot be changed. If a lab test is performed and the results are saved as a PDF in S3, that file is locked. If new results come in, a new file must be created and a new record added to the blockchain. The old record remains, providing a full, verifiable history.By combining an immutable blockchain with immutable cloud storage, you create a powerful, two-layer system that is fully tamper-proof. The blockchain serves as the unalterable index and proof of existence for data that is permanently stored in the cloud.
##Implementation Of BlockChain
Now coming to a part where our project is revolving around- *BlockChain* for our current prototype to keep it light and have room for more improvements we used a *Single Node BlockChain* which serves as our proof of concept for the minimum variable project and also exhibit the core principles of immutable, chronological ledger. The Single Node Blockchain really shines in our program by crytographycally linking each new herb record record to the one that came before it which proves that the data cannot be tampered. Let's go slow here- the *Single Node Blockchain* is located in **app.py** file that takes our input data and uses a cryptografic function **hashlib.sha256** to create a unqique hash for each and every record we input while also keeping the chain that connects the new record with previous record's hash. If provided with an oppurtunity to present our Idea we are readly to integrate *multinode Blockchain Hyperledger Fabric* to increase the potential of the current ledger which will include quality and many more features.
##Pitching Challenges and Funding
In 2025 where AI is ruling the market standards having an app that focuses only on adding data and securing will sound like the same old fashioned pen and paper for companies that also want to increase their reach, growth and even profits through us. Even though this project is made with the concept of helping farmer, Judges get shocked if we add a point for income stating it as "You are thinking it like a bussiness" same happened to me when I presented my Project, but our intention was never to make profits on farmers but from  initial seed funding from grants focused on technology for social good or agricultural development. The Smart India Hackathon itself is a form of this, providing initial validation. Our next step- Partnership & Corporate Sponsorship Source: Our main strategy for large-scale development would be through partnerships. We would approach major Ayurvedic companies (like Dabur, Himalaya, or Patanjali) and largescale herb processors. Purpose: We would present our pilot program to them, showcasing the benefits of increased consumer trust, reduced fraud, and streamlined compliance. They would then fund the expansion of the network in exchange for access to our platform and its data. This model is common for enterprise blockchain solutions like IBM Food Trust. And our final phase Service-Based Revenue Source: Once the platform is mature, we would monetize it through a tiered, service-based model. Purpose: Tier 1 (Producers): Farmers and collectors would have free or low-cost access, as they are the source of the data. Tier 2 (Processors & Manufacturers): These companies would pay a small fee per transaction or on a subscription basis to use the platform. This fee is justified by the immense value they get from reduced risk, streamlined logistics, and increased consumer confidence. Tier 3 (Regulators & Auditors): Government bodies could pay a subscription for access to a real-time, tamper-proof audit trail of the entire supply chain. We came up with such a realistic detail about how we divided our funding into three phases and how our project can grow exponentially considering our herbal protoype if not the first but an idea that could change the Ayurvedic market. 
##AI development
The AI tools we initially planned to use for our final design are as follows- Autoencoders / Isolation Forest → For anomaly detection (fake entries in the blockchain). Graph-based ML models → To detect fraudulent nodes/records in the supply chain. Currently focusing only on fraud detection for fake entries and inspection of fake nodes and we are still researching for better improvements as the project goes on.
##Reaserch and Refrences
We finally reach the end of this blog and will discuss a bit about our research and wrap it up - most of the products that focus on *Blockchain* such as IBM Food Trust, SAP Cloud Platform BlockChain, Provenance all focusing on food and goods but no such application for Ayurvedic Herbs. Which ultimately gives us an edge if our product succeeds and is released in the market it can have a big imapact on farmers, manufacturers and even consumers who pay a lot of their hard earned money for getting the Ayurvedic Herb.
